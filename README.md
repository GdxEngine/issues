## Info
### Getting started

Here you will report your problem that you are facing when using GdxEngine (or, searching), don't forget to report it too:

- Your device's android version with SDK (e.g: Android 11, SDK 30).
- Your device's brand/OEM (e.g: Samsung).
- Your device's name (e.g: Galaxy A20s).
- Your device's arch (e.g: armv8-v8a).
- Logcat if needed (if you don't know how to, [check this](https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-take-logs-android/)).

It is important to describe your problem and how to reproduce it, so that we can fix it quickly in future versions.
